# SentriusCentral

This is an incomplete Qt based application for the mass programming of sentrius sensors. It was last updated in November 2018 and I have no plans to ever look at this code again. It is released under the GPLv3 license.

The source/binary SB application which runs on a BT900/BL620/BL652/BL654 is not provided.

Do not open bugs or message/email asking for help or support with this, I offer no guarantee about it's state or functionality and offer no help with this code, it is provided "as-is"..
